git-buildpackage (0.4.61) unstable; urgency=low

  In order to not override dpkg-buildpackge's defaults for 3.0 source packages
  the default builder command is now "debuild -i -I" instead of "debuild
  -i\.git/ -I.git". If you want to retain the old behaviour please adjust your
  gbp.conf accordingly.

git-buildpackage (0.4.57) unstable; urgency=low

  git-import-orig dosn't generate changelog entries by default anymore. This
  means you can safely remove --no-dch from all your scripts and config files.

  If you want git-import-orig to behave as before add:
     postimport = dch -v%(version)s New Upstream Version
  to your gbp.conf. If you want to invoke git-dch instead, you can use:
     postimport = git-dch -N%(version)s -S -a
  The later is recommended since it creates git-dch compatible changelog
  entries.

git-buildpackage (0.3.3) unstable; urgency=low

  As of this version git-buildpackage doesn't pass hardcoded '-i\.git -I.git'
  to the build command specified via --git-builder (or via the builder config
  file options). So if you're not using the default build command (which is
  now 'debuild -i\.git -I.git' instead of just plain 'debuild') you'll have to
  add these options to your build command in order to exclude git metadata
  from your diffs and source tarballs.
  This was done to make the invocation of the build command more flexible, we
  don't rely on debuild behaviour from now on.
  Again: if you didn't change the default build command, you don't have to
  change anything.

git-buildpackage (0.2.25) unstable; urgency=low

  Generated tags are now by default put into debian/ and upstream/ namespaces.
  This doesn't have any effect on already existing tags.
